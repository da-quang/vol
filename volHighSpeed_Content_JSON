When you leave the harbor, your phone often connects to the ship’s satellite network instead of a regular country network. These maritime networks are not covered by EU roaming rules, leading to very high costs—for example, sending a single photo can cost 10 to 15 euros, and even missed calls forwarded to voicemail can incur charges.\n\nMany travelers don’t realize this happens because their phones automatically use data in the background for emails, photo uploads, or app updates, all over the costly ship network. To avoid unexpected high bills, the article suggests a simple checklist before boarding:\n\n1. Disable data roaming on your phone to stop automatic data use.\n2. Turn off your voicemail to prevent charges from forwarded calls.\n3. Use airplane mode and selectively enable Wi-Fi, such as the ship’s Wi-Fi package.\n4. Prepare for offline use by downloading movies, music, maps, and other content before the trip.\n\nThe article concludes that by following these steps, you can enjoy a relaxing cruise without worrying about your phone bill.

It highlights three common cost traps:\n\n1. **Mailbox Charges:** Even missed calls forwarded to your voicemail abroad can incur charges, as the call routes internationally. Listening to voicemail messages abroad can also cost extra. To avoid this, disable your voicemail before traveling using a GSM code (e.g., ##002#) or phone settings, and avoid checking voicemail outside the EU.\n\n2. **Wi-Fi Calling Costs:** Although Wi-Fi calling sounds free, it can be expensive abroad because calls may be routed through your home mobile network and billed as international calls. To prevent this, turn off Wi-Fi calling before your trip and use internet-based apps like WhatsApp or Signal for truly free calls.\n\n3. **Roaming Outside the EU:** Traveling near or into non-EU countries (e.g., Switzerland, Turkey, USA) can lead to unexpected roaming charges, especially if your phone automatically switches networks. To avoid this, disable data roaming near borders, use offline maps, and manually select your network.\n\nThe article also offers a handy checklist before traveling: disable voicemail, turn off Wi-Fi calling, check roaming settings, download offline maps, and use internet apps for calls.\n\nThe overall message encourages travelers to take simple steps to stay reachable while preventing costly phone bills.

Unlike traditional Wi-Fi repeaters that rely on wireless signals, Powerline technology sends internet signals through power lines, allowing internet access in any room without additional cables.\n\nThe set includes two adapters: one connects to the router via LAN cable and plugs into a power outlet, while the other plugs into an outlet in another room to provide internet via LAN or Wi-Fi. It supports Wi-Fi 6 (WLAN AX) for faster and more reliable connections, offers speeds up to 1,200 Mbit/s, supports mesh Wi-Fi for seamless network integration, and includes secure 128-bit AES encryption.\n\nPowerline is especially useful in homes with thick walls, underfloor heating, multiple floors, or in multi-network environments where Wi-Fi signals struggle. It is also ideal when the router is located far from the main living areas, such as in a basement or technical room.\n\nHowever, Powerline has limitations: both adapters must be on the same electrical circuit, it should not be used with power strips or multiple sockets as this reduces performance, and older electrical wiring (over 40 years old) may affect speed. To test compatibility, users can plug both adapters into outlets in the same room to check if they connect.\n\nSetting up the FRITZ!Powerline 1240 AX is simple: connect the first adapter to the router and a power outlet, plug the second adapter into a power outlet where internet is needed, wait for automatic connection, and press the WPS button if Wi-Fi is desired. Multiple adapters (up to 16) can be used to cover an entire house.\n\nIn summary, the FRITZ!Powerline 1240 AX WLAN Set offers a practical and effective alternative to Wi-Fi repeaters, providing stable, fast internet throughout the home with easy installation, making it suitable for large homes or those with challenging Wi-Fi environments."},{"@odata.etag":"","ItemInternalId":"1f7b7e0a-2605-46f2-a128-285808860c4a","Summary":"The text explains how to improve weak or slow Wi-Fi signals in homes using the FRITZ!Repeater 1200 AX, a device that boosts existing Wi-Fi coverage. It highlights that slow Wi-Fi is often due to the signal not reaching all rooms, not necessarily the internet connection itself.\n\nKey points include:\n\n- The FRITZ!Repeater 1200 AX uses the latest Wi-Fi 6 technology, supports dual-band (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), and integrates well with FRITZ!Box routers to provide faster, more stable Wi-Fi in areas with poor coverage.\n- For best results, the repeater should be placed about halfway between the router and the area with weak Wi-Fi.\n- Wi-Fi signals can be weakened by thick walls, steel-reinforced concrete, water pipes, underfloor heating, and interference from devices like microwaves or Bluetooth gadgets.\n- The repeater is ideal for apartments or smaller houses where Wi-Fi needs to be strengthened in specific rooms and the router is not too far away (1-2 rooms).\n- In cases of large distances, strong physical barriers, or many neighboring Wi-Fi networks causing interference, a Powerline adapter is recommended instead. This device uses the home's electrical wiring to transmit internet signals, providing stable coverage even across floors without Wi-Fi signal loss.\n- Powerline adapters require that the electrical outlets be on the same circuit to work effectively.\n- The article concludes by advising users to choose the FRITZ!Repeater 1200 AX for simple, localized Wi-Fi boosting and the FRITZ!Powerline 1240 AX set for overcoming structural obstacles or covering larger homes.\n- Additional tips include avoiding chaining multiple repeaters and testing Wi-Fi strength with speed tests to find optimal repeater placement.\n- The text also offers contact information for customer support and links to further resources on related topics.\n\nOverall, the article provides practical advice on enhancing home Wi-Fi coverage, explaining when to use a repeater versus a Powerline adapter based on home layout and interference factors."},{"@odata.etag":"","ItemInternalId":"577db59e-f6e0-4ba6-9ecb-ef42d9f2a85a","Summary":"The text discusses the increasing sophistication of phishing and spam emails in 2025, highlighting how scammers now use artificial intelligence (AI) to create highly convincing and personalized fraudulent emails. Unlike in the past, when phishing emails were easy to spot due to poor grammar and suspicious addresses, modern phishing attempts often include real names, authentic-looking company logos, and flawless language, making them difficult to distinguish from legitimate messages.\n\nKey phishing methods in 2025 include:\n\n1. **AI-generated personalized emails**: Scammers analyze online activity and public data to craft emails that mimic the style and branding of real companies, often urging immediate action like account suspension or overdue payments to create panic.\n\n2. **QR-code phishing**: Since many email providers block suspicious links, scammers embed QR codes in emails that, when scanned, lead to fake websites designed to steal login or payment information.\n\n3. **Phishing impersonating authorities**: Fraudulent emails pretend to be from government agencies, requesting sensitive information or payments, though official bodies rarely send such requests via email.\n\nIf a user clicks on a phishing link, consequences can include stolen login credentials, unauthorized account access, or malware infection such as trojans or ransomware. Immediate actions recommended are changing passwords, contacting banks if financial data is involved, running antivirus scans, and enabling two-factor authentication.\n\nTo recognize phishing emails, the text advises:\n\n- Carefully checking the sender’s email address for authenticity.\n- Avoiding opening suspicious attachments, especially those with file types known to carry malware (.zip, .exe, .docx with macros).\n- Using tools like virus scanners to check attachments before opening.\n\nIf a suspicious email is received on a vol.at email account, users are encouraged to delete it and contact customer service for assistance.\n\nThe overall message emphasizes vigilance, careful scrutiny of emails, and proactive security measures to protect personal data against increasingly sophisticated phishing attacks.

WLAN, auch als „Wi-Fi“ bekannt, nutzt Funksignale, meist auf Frequenzen von 2,4 GHz und 5 GHz, um diese Verbindung herzustellen.\n\nDie Idee hinter WLAN reicht bis in die 1940er Jahre zurück, als das „Frequency Hopping“ für militärische Zwecke entwickelt wurde. In den 1960er Jahren entstand das „Aloha-Net“ an der Universität von Hawaii, ein frühes Funknetzwerk. Später brachte das Unternehmen Lucent die ersten drahtlosen Netzwerkkomponenten namens „WaveLan“ auf den Markt, die jedoch teuer und zunächst vor allem für Unternehmen gedacht waren. 1999 machte Apple mit dem „iBook“ und der „Airport-Technologie“ WLAN für Privatanwender erschwinglich und populär. Seitdem sind die Preise gesunken, und WLAN ist heute in fast jedem Haushalt verbreitet.\n\nFür die Nutzung von WLAN benötigt man einen WLAN-fähigen Router, der das Internetsignal über verschiedene Quellen wie SIM-Karte (LTE/5G), Fernsehkabel oder DSL empfängt. Nach Aktivierung der WLAN-Funktion sendet der Router Funksignale, mit denen sich Geräte nach Eingabe eines Passworts verbinden können. Ein Router kann mehrere Geräte gleichzeitig versorgen. WLAN bietet den Vorteil, dass man nicht an Kabel gebunden ist und in den eigenen vier Wänden flexibel surfen, streamen oder spielen kann. Bei schwachem Signal gibt es Möglichkeiten zur Verstärkung, etwa durch Powerline-Technologie, die das Internet über Stromleitungen weiterleitet. Auch die Optimierung des WLAN-Kanals kann helfen, die Verbindung zu verbessern.\n\nZusätzlich bietet die Quelle weiterführende Informationen und Tipps zur Verbesserung der WLAN-Verbindung sowie verwandte Themen rund um Internet und Technik. Die Autorin Alexandra Höller ist Teil des VOLhighspeed-Teams und informiert regelmäßig über digitale Trends und Entwicklungen."},{"@odata.etag":"","ItemInternalId":"a0196571-d677-4531-8648-25c1b122bc70","Summary":"The article explains how to optimize your home WLAN (Wi-Fi) connection for better performance. It highlights common causes of poor Wi-Fi, such as building materials (like steel-reinforced concrete, moisture, or glass), interference from household electronics (microwaves, baby monitors, Bluetooth devices), and distance from the router. These factors can weaken the Wi-Fi signal and cause slow or unstable connections.\n\nTo improve Wi-Fi, the article advises placing the modem/router in a central, elevated location with minimal obstacles and away from interfering devices. For activities requiring stable connections like streaming or online gaming, using a wired LAN cable directly to the device is recommended to avoid signal loss and interference.\n\nFor larger homes or multi-story buildings, Powerline adapters are suggested as a better alternative to Wi-Fi repeaters. Powerline adapters use the home's electrical wiring to extend the internet signal to distant rooms, providing more reliable coverage without significant speed loss.\n\nAnother tip is to check if your Wi-Fi channel is overcrowded, especially in densely populated areas where neighbors’ networks may overlap. Changing the router’s channel to a less congested one can improve performance. If problems persist, contacting your internet provider for assistance or upgrading your internet package might be necessary.\n\nIn summary, optimizing your Wi-Fi involves proper router placement, minimizing interference, using wired connections when possible, extending coverage with Powerline adapters, and managing Wi-Fi channels. These steps can enhance your wireless internet experience without major costs."},{"@odata.etag":"","ItemInternalId":"b18b567a-c2ba-4309-815c-54b0a5cd3e83","Summary":"The provided text is a collection of blog entries and information from VOLhighspeed, a digital service provider.
