When a cruise ship leaves the harbor, your phone often connects to the ship’s satellite network instead of a regular country network. These maritime networks are not covered by EU roaming rules, leading to very high costs—for example, sending one WhatsApp photo can cost 10 to 15 euros, and even missed calls forwarded to voicemail can incur charges.\n\nMany travelers don’t realize this happens because their phones automatically use data in the background for emails, photo uploads, or app updates, all at high prices. To avoid unexpected bills, the article suggests a checklist before boarding:\n\n1. Disable data roaming to stop automatic mobile data use.\n2. Turn off voicemail to prevent charges from forwarded calls.\n3. Use airplane mode and selectively enable Wi-Fi, such as the ship’s Wi-Fi package.\n4. Prepare for offline use by downloading movies, music, maps, and other content before the trip.\n\nThe article concludes that by following these simple steps, travelers can enjoy their cruise without worrying about costly phone bills.

It highlights three common cost traps:\n\n1. **Mailbox Charges:** Even missed calls forwarded to your voicemail can incur roaming fees, as the call routes internationally. Listening to voicemail abroad can also cost extra. To avoid this, disable your voicemail before traveling using a GSM code (e.g., ##002#) or phone settings, and avoid checking messages outside the EU.\n\n2. **Wi-Fi Calling Costs:** Although Wi-Fi calling sounds free, some phones route these calls through your mobile provider, charging international rates. To prevent unexpected bills, turn off Wi-Fi calling before your trip and use internet-based apps like WhatsApp or Signal for free calls.\n\n3. **Country Borders and Roaming:** Traveling near or crossing borders into non-EU countries (e.g., Switzerland, Turkey, USA) can cause your phone to roam on expensive networks without you realizing it, leading to high data charges. To avoid this, disable data roaming near borders, use offline maps, and manually select your network.\n\nThe article concludes with a handy checklist before traveling: disable voicemail, turn off Wi-Fi calling, check roaming settings, download offline maps, and use apps for calls. Following these tips helps travelers stay connected without incurring costly phone bills.

Here are the five main reasons and solutions:\n\n1. **Router Placement**: If your router is hidden in a corner, closet, or basement, the Wi-Fi signal weakens as it passes through walls and furniture. To fix this, place the router centrally in your home, avoid enclosed spaces, and consider Wi-Fi extenders for larger areas or multiple floors.\n\n2. **Too Many Devices Online**: Multiple devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and smart home gadgets using the internet simultaneously share the available bandwidth, slowing down the connection. Check your router’s connected devices, disconnect unused ones, and prioritize important devices if your router supports it.\n\n3. **Outdated Hardware**: Old routers or computers may not support modern high-speed Wi-Fi standards, limiting your internet speed. Check if your router supports newer Wi-Fi versions (like Wi-Fi 5 or 6) and consider upgrading or using affordable USB Wi-Fi adapters for older devices.\n\n4. **Wi-Fi vs. Wired Connection**: Wi-Fi speeds are often slower than wired (LAN) connections due to interference and distance. For critical tasks like work or gaming, use a LAN cable or powerline adapters that transmit internet through your home’s electrical wiring. Also, connect to the 5 GHz Wi-Fi band near the router for faster speeds.\n\n5. **Background Apps and Services**: Programs running in the background, such as system updates, cloud syncing, or multiple browser tabs with videos, consume bandwidth without you noticing. Close unnecessary apps, disable automatic updates during important activities, and use energy-saving modes on mobile devices to reduce background data use.\n\nThe article encourages readers to share their experiences and offers additional resources on related topics like refurbished devices and home networking solutions.

Unlike traditional Wi-Fi repeaters that rely on wireless signals, Powerline technology sends internet signals through power lines, allowing internet access in any room without additional cables.\n\nThe set includes two adapters: one connects to the router via LAN cable and plugs into a power outlet, while the other plugs into an outlet in another room to provide internet via LAN or Wi-Fi. It supports Wi-Fi 6 (WLAN AX) for faster and more reliable connections, offers speeds up to 1,200 Mbit/s, supports mesh Wi-Fi for seamless network integration, and includes secure 128-bit AES encryption.\n\nPowerline is especially useful in homes with thick walls, floor heating, multiple floors, or in multi-network environments where Wi-Fi signals may be disrupted. However, it requires that the adapters be on the same electrical circuit, should not be plugged into power strips, and may perform poorly with very old wiring.\n\nSetting up the FRITZ!Powerline 1240 AX is simple: plug the first adapter near the router and connect it via LAN cable, plug the second adapter where internet is needed, wait for automatic connection, and optionally press the WPS button to extend Wi-Fi. Multiple adapters can be used to cover an entire house.\n\nIn summary, this Powerline set is an effective alternative to Wi-Fi repeaters, ideal for large or complex homes, offering flexible LAN and Wi-Fi connections with easy installation and reliable performance. If unsure about compatibility, a simple test by plugging both adapters into outlets in the same room can indicate if it will work in the home."},{"@odata.etag":"","ItemInternalId":"3bf03955-3cf4-4c87-89c7-879ac2383451","Summary":"The text explains how to improve weak or slow Wi-Fi signals in homes using the FRITZ!Repeater 1200 AX, a device that boosts existing Wi-Fi coverage. It highlights that slow Wi-Fi is often due to the signal not reaching all rooms, not necessarily the internet connection itself.\n\nKey points include:\n\n- The FRITZ!Repeater 1200 AX uses the latest Wi-Fi 6 technology, supports dual-band (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), and integrates well with FRITZ!Box routers to provide faster, more stable Wi-Fi in areas with poor coverage.\n- For best results, the repeater should be placed about halfway between the router and the area with weak Wi-Fi.\n- Wi-Fi signals can be weakened by thick walls, steel-reinforced concrete, water pipes, underfloor heating, and interference from devices like microwaves or Bluetooth gadgets.\n- The repeater is ideal for apartments or smaller houses where Wi-Fi needs to be strengthened in specific rooms and the router is not too far away (1-2 rooms).\n- In cases of large distances, strong physical barriers, or many neighboring Wi-Fi networks causing interference, a Powerline adapter is recommended instead. This device uses the home's electrical wiring to transmit internet signals, providing stable coverage even across floors without Wi-Fi signal loss.\n- Powerline adapters require that the electrical outlets be on the same circuit to work effectively.\n- The article concludes by advising users to choose the FRITZ!Repeater 1200 AX for simple, localized Wi-Fi boosting and the FRITZ!Powerline 1240 AX set for overcoming structural obstacles or covering larger homes.\n- Additional tips include avoiding chaining multiple repeaters and testing Wi-Fi strength with speed tests to find optimal repeater placement.\n- The text also offers contact information for customer support and links to further resources on related topics.\n\nOverall, the article provides practical advice on enhancing home Wi-Fi coverage, explaining when to use a repeater versus a Powerline adapter based on home layout and interference factors."},{"@odata.etag":"","ItemInternalId":"b02b124c-9f7b-4e05-9874-84532e990de7","Summary":"The text discusses the increasing sophistication of phishing and spam emails in 2025, highlighting how scammers now use artificial intelligence (AI) to create highly convincing and personalized fraudulent emails. Unlike in the past, when phishing emails were easy to spot due to poor grammar and suspicious addresses, modern phishing attempts often include real names, authentic-looking company logos, and flawless language, making them difficult to distinguish from legitimate messages.\n\nKey phishing methods in 2025 include:\n\n1. **AI-generated personalized emails**: Scammers analyze online activity and public data to craft emails that mimic the style and branding of real companies, often urging immediate action like account suspension or overdue payments to create panic.\n\n2. **QR-code phishing**: Since many email providers block suspicious links, scammers embed QR codes in emails that, when scanned, lead to fake websites designed to steal login or payment information.\n\n3. **Phishing impersonating authorities**: Fraudulent emails pretend to be from government agencies, requesting sensitive information or payments, though official bodies rarely send such requests via email.\n\nIf a user clicks on a phishing link, consequences can include stolen login credentials, unauthorized account access, or malware infection such as trojans or ransomware. Immediate actions recommended are changing passwords, contacting banks if financial data is involved, running antivirus scans, and enabling two-factor authentication.\n\nTo recognize phishing emails, the text advises:\n\n- Carefully checking the sender’s email address for authenticity.\n- Avoiding opening suspicious attachments, especially those with file types known to carry malware (.zip, .exe, .docx with macros).\n- Using tools like virus scanners to check attachments before opening.\n\nIf a suspicious email is received on a vol.at email account, users are encouraged to delete it and contact customer service for assistance.\n\nThe overall message emphasizes vigilance, careful scrutiny of emails, and proactive security measures to protect personal data against increasingly sophisticated phishing attacks.

The term \"Wi-Fi\" is a marketing name rather than a technical abbreviation.\n\nThe concept of wireless communication dates back to the 1940s with \"Frequency Hopping,\" originally developed for military use. In 1969, the University of Hawaii created the \"Aloha-Net,\" a radio network connecting different parts of the university. Later, the company Lucent introduced the first wireless network components called \"WaveLan,\" but initially, WLAN was expensive and not widely used in private homes.\n\nIn 1999, Apple made WLAN more accessible by including \"Airport\" technology in its iBook laptops, which worked with a base station costing around $300 and a wireless card costing about $100. This made WLAN affordable for students and private users, leading to rapid growth and development by other companies. Over time, prices dropped, and now most households in Austria have WLAN.\n\nTo use WLAN, you need a router that receives the internet signal via SIM card, cable, or DSL. The router broadcasts the wireless signal on frequencies between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Devices connect to this signal by entering a password, allowing multiple devices to access the internet simultaneously without cables. If the signal is weak in some areas, solutions like Powerline adapters can extend coverage. Overloaded WLAN channels can also cause issues, and there are ways to optimize your connection.\n\nThe article is written by Alexandra Höller from VOLhighspeed, a company providing internet services, and invites readers to engage with the blog and explore related topics such as internet speed, refurbished devices, and network optimization. Contact information and social media links for VOLhighspeed are also provided."},{"@odata.etag":"","ItemInternalId":"2c9a5441-f51f-494d-b367-b1f06d28f535","Summary":"The text provides a comprehensive guide on how to optimize your home WLAN (Wi-Fi) connection for better performance. It explains common causes of poor Wi-Fi signals, such as building materials (e.g., steel concrete, moisture, glass), interference from household electronics (microwaves, baby monitors, Bluetooth devices), and distance from the router. It highlights that many devices and environmental factors can weaken Wi-Fi signals.\n\nKey advice includes placing the modem/router in an open, elevated spot away from obstacles and electronic devices that cause interference. For activities requiring stable connections like streaming and online gaming, using a wired LAN cable connection is recommended to avoid signal loss and interference.\n\nTo extend Wi-Fi coverage in larger or multi-story homes, the text suggests using Powerline adapters, which transmit internet signals through the electrical wiring, offering better performance than Wi-Fi repeaters that can lose speed due to obstacles.\n\nAnother issue addressed is crowded Wi-Fi channels in densely populated areas, which can degrade signal quality. Users can manually change their router’s Wi-Fi channel to a less congested one or contact their internet provider for assistance.\n\nThe conclusion emphasizes that improving Wi-Fi often requires simple, low-cost steps such as repositioning the router, removing interfering devices, using signal extenders like Powerline adapters, or upgrading the internet package if needed. The article encourages readers to try these solutions and consult their provider if problems persist.\n\nAdditional information includes links to related topics, contact details for VOLhighspeed, and social media channels.
